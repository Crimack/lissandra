# Lissandra

A Python adaptation of the Riot Games Teamfight Tactics API (https://developer.riotgames.com/).

Lissandra is a fork of Cassiopeia, a wrapper for the main League of Legends API. It provides a similar, user-friendly experience but focuses only on the TeamFight Tactics (TFT) APIs.

## Roadmap

*Note*: This library is currently a work in progress. Stuff might move around or never get finished.

- [x] Fork from Cassiopeia and rewrite the history
- [x] Support the summoner API
- [x] Support the leagues API
- [x] Join summoner API to league (mr_wiggles = TFTSummoner(), mr_wiggles.league) type stuff
- [ ] Write a Cdragon data provider (DDragon has no static data for TFT)
- [ ] Model TFT items/stats
- [ ] Support the match history API
- [ ] Support the match API

## Why use Lissandra?

* Works on on the Cassiopeia tech stack, which has been refined over the past few years by the [Meraki Analytics team](https://github.com/meraki-analytics).

* An excellent user interface that makes working with data from the Riot API easy and fun.

* "Perfect" rate limiting.

* Guaranteed optimal usage of your API key.

* Built in caching and (coming) the ability to easily hook into a database for offline storage of data.

* Dynamic settings so you can configure Liss for your specific use case.
